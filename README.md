# Micro_Robo_Controller_Arm_Hand
Evan Varga and I embarked on integrating a WidowX Robotic Arm controlled by an Arbotix - M Arduino with a robotic hand controlled by a Tiva C Series TM4C123G microcontroller. Through the micrcontroller's Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter module, commands were sent to the microcontroller to make the hand and arm perform creative gestures and actions.
